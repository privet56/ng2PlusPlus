Research Project (based on contract):
A research project is a research activity carried out in collaboration with an academic partner with a defined content and time period. Content, goals, degrees of goal specification as well as the form of collaboration may vary. Research projects can be carried out by the academic partner alone (contract research) or jointly with the involved Siemens Unit (joint research project). The contractual basis of a research project is usually an individual or project contract (individual agreement). A research project is different from a feasibility study or a publicly funded project.

Feasibility Study (based on contract):
A project with an academic partner, which investigates the implementation options, opportunities and risks of a research project planned for a later date, a new technology, an application or similar, is called a feasibility study (or pre-project or project study). A feasibility study is usually based on an individual or project agreement.

Publicly Funded Project (based on contract):
Publicly funded projects are projects, which usually involve several partners from private industry and the academic world. Non-academic partners contribute with their own services to publicly funded projects, but usually receive part of their total project costs from the respective funding body. In Germany, public funding sources for large companies like Siemens are usually federal ministries (e.g. Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology or Federal Environment Ministry), but occasionally also state ministries, the EU commission in Europe, and in the US, for instance, the NSF (National Science Foundation) or the DoE (Department of Energy).

PhD Project (based on contract with PhD candidate):
PhD projects refer to research activities, which result in the writing and presentation of a dissertation. The PhD student is usually an employee of Siemens during the time of his/ her PhD project/ thesis.
This collaboration type does not include a budget field since the money paid for a PhD project usually goes to the PhD student and not to the university. In case part of the money of a PhD project is paid to a professor, this part of the project has to be entered in UNICO⁺ as a separate research project, and afterwards has to be linked to the existing PhD project using the “is part of” field.

Lectureship:
A Siemens employee can give lectures without being employed by an academic partner. The lectureship is usually unpaid or is remunerated on a fee basis. In this context, a lectureship refers only to longer-term lecture courses (at least 1 semester). One-time lectures or sporadic participation in university events should not be entered into UNICO⁺. If the lectureship is temporary, the start and end date have to be included. If the lectureship is permanent, only the start date should be stated and the “ongoing” status should be selected. When the lectureship has ended, the end date should be added to the data record in UNICO⁺.

Honorary Professorship (without contract):
There are two types of honorary professorships. Honorary professors are either persons who received a so-called “titular professorship” because of their academic efforts at and special relations with a university (German: "Ehrenprofessur") or they are awarded a honorary title (German: "Honorarprofessur") for being a private or visiting lecturer. Both continue to be employed full-time by Siemens, but participate in teaching at the university. Since an honorary professorship is usually awarded permanently, the start date should be entered and the status “ongoing” should be selected.

Membership in Academic Bodies (with and without remuneration):
Membership in academic bodies refers to an institutionalized membership of a Siemens employee in a university body, (e.g.: Academic Senate, Council, advisory boards, committees on degree programs, etc.). Memberships in other academic-type bodies which are not part of a university should not be entered into UNICO⁺.
If the membership is temporary, the start and end date have to be included. Permanent memberships require entry of the start date and the status selection “ongoing”. When the membership has ended, the end date should be added to the data record in UNICO⁺.
Please note: Paid memberships of any kind also require a compliance release in SpoDoM!

Expert Exchange (part time):
A Siemens employee becomes a member of an academic partner for a definite period of time to work with scientists of the academic partner on a specific research activity (e.g. by being appointed to a study group, an institute, or similar). Employment with Siemens will continue.

Expert Exchange (sabbatical):
A Siemens employee is released from work temporarily and joins an academic partner for a definite period of time (at least a few months) to do research there.

Other (only in exceptional cases):
Before choosing the collaboration type “Other”, please check carefully whether your collaboration activity is in the scope of UNICO+ and cannot be assigned to one of the other collaborations types. The category “Other” covers the following examples of collaboration activities:
•	Invest in equipment or infrastructure at a university
   (e.g. contribution to a new research center)
•	In-kind donations (if not yet covered in SpoDoM)
•	Free use of prototypes or testing equipment
•	Software licences, PLM software for free or for a discount price
•	CKI partnerships
