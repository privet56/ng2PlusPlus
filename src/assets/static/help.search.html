The Search & Reporting function offers a wide variety of analyses and print options. In the top section of the Search & Reporting area, the user can specify any number of filter criteria in different categories which can be combined. Each filter criterion is shown in a separate line. The filter criteria specified limit the collaborations to be analyzed or the analysis time period. The different criteria are explained below.
<br>For more information please see the UNICO? manual. 
<br>
<br>The available filter criteria categories include:
<br>
<br>Academic Partners:
<br>Academic partners are divided into universities, research centers, research associations, affiliated clinic and affiliated organizations. The research associations include all institutes of the Fraunhofer Society, the Max-Planck-Society, the Leibniz Association and the Helmholtz Association worldwide.
<br>The hierarchy of the academic partners is reproduced in UNICO?. For instance, the “Max Planck Institute for Computer Sciences” is subordinated to the Max Planck Society. For universities and affiliated entities, a similar hierarchy can be defined. For example, the university hospital “Klinikum rechts der Isar der Technischen Universität München” is assigned to “Technical University of Munich”.
<br>A number of academic partners belong to several other academic partners (e.g. the university hospital “Charité” in Berlin is part of the Free University and the Humboldt University). In these special cases, the academic partners involved will be represented as independent collaboration partners and are not assigned to any of the higher-level academic partners.
<br>For analyzing higher-level partners, the user can specify whether the analysis should include the affiliated partners or not.
<br>All academic partners are assigned to the country in which they are located.
<br>
<br>Siemens Unit:
<br>Limits the number of matches to collaborations which are assigned to the Org-Levels specified. Specification of Org-Level 1 is mandatory. For CT collaborations you can additionally filter for collaborations which have the specified Team assigned.
<br>
<br>Collaboration Type:
<br>Selects only collaborations which have the specified Collaboration Type assigned.
<br>
<br>Collaboration Status:
<br>Limits the number of matches to collaborations with today's status: active means that the collaboration is active at the day you're performing the report, completed means that the collaboration is completed at the day you're performing the report, etc.
<br>
<br>Timeframe of Interest:
<br>When selecting this filter criterion, you have multiple selection possibilities.
<br>Either you can specify whether the timeframe you are interested in should be indicated by fiscal years or by entering a start and end date. The number of matches will be limited to the collaborations which overlap for at least one day with the time period indicated. 
<br>Please note: When using a filter that indicates the timeframe of interest in days, no budgets will be included in the list of matches and in the analyses, since at this detailed level, no information about the budget of the collaborations stored is collected.
<br>
<br>You can also filter independent from the duration of the project but based on other temporal indications:
<br>
<br>Collaborations created between:
<br>Limits the number of matches to collaborations which have been entered into UNICO? within the timeframe specified. This date does not necessarily coincide with the start of the collaboration.
<br>
<br>Collaborations started between:
<br>Limits the number of matches to collaborations which started within the start and end dates specified.
<br>
<br>Collaborations ended between:
<br>Limits the number of matches to collaborations which ended within the start and end dates specified.
<br>
<br>Country:
<br>When using this filter criterion, you also have to specify whether to filter for a Siemens unit, a collaboration partner (academic partner) or a public funding source in a specified country. 
<br>
<br>My Collaborations:
<br>This function allows you to list all the collaborations assigned to you. With the second filter criterion you can further select by:
<br>a) "created by me": displays all the collaborations which you have ever created
<br>b) "last modified by me": displays all the collaborations for which you have been the recent editor
<br>c) "owned by me": displays all the collaborations that you are responsible for 
<br>
<br>Search Term:
<br>Specific search terms can be integrated in the Reporting by using the field “Search Terms”. It works like the search in the “Simple Search” tab. Like other filter criteria, the criterion “Search Term” in the “Search & Reporting” tab can be selected several times. The different search terms are then connected using OR. (This allows e.g. the following search: create a report about all collaborations which contain the phrase “Smart Grid” or “SmartGrid”).
<br>
<br>Funding Program:
<br>Limits the number of matches to Publicly Funded Projects of a specified Funding Program.
